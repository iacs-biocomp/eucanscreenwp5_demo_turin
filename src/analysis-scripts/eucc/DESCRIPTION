Description: This is an open source software for producing key quality and peformance 
    indicators for cancer screening in Europe, initiated by the EUCanScreen Joint Action project. 
    Performance indicators are mostly based on earlier work in the CanScreen-ECIS project, 
    and rely on a standardized data model (CDM) for cancer screening.
